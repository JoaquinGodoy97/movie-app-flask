# movie-app-flask

    #first step idea    
    This is a movie App that takes a movie API. I'm using the framework flask for the backend coding. For displaying I used Bootstrap and a bit of CSS. The app also includes a custom pagination functionality as well as a basic display of a list of movies.

    So far I made used of:
    -Bootstrap (alerts, tooltips)
    -Python
    -Jinja2 Engine
    -Flask libraries, flask Global objects (request, response, json, ...)

        #issues fixed
        *empty search results
        *disable prev&next buttons from html jinja


    #second step idea
    The next idea involves using a mySQL data base from the library flask_sqlalchemy inside Flask. 
    
    So far I made used of:
